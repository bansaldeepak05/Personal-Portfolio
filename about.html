        <div class="about">
        <p> My name is Deepak, and I grew up in Delhi, the capital city of India. I completed my schooling at G.D. 
            Goenka Public School. From an early age, I developed a strong interest in computers, which led me to pursue 
            Computer Science. During high school, I gained proficiency in various programming languages, including HTML, 
            Python, and SQL. In addition to my academic interests, I am passionate about sports, with soccer being my 
            favorite hobby. Although I have been introverted for most of my life, taking a Public Speaking course at UVic 
            has significantly boosted my confidence."                                                                
            I have participated in various Model United Nations (MUN) conferences, which have significantly enhanced my 
            verbal communication skills. Additionally, being elected as a member of the council in these events has 
            provided me with valuable leadership experience. Overall, it has been a fulfilling journey, and I look 
            forward to what lies ahead.
